# Estimation of microwave optical systems' proprieties through neural networks

Bachelor Thesis at the Dept. of Physics, University of Milan, January-July 2020

Supervisor: Prof. [Maurizio Tomasi](https://github.com/ziotom78)

## Description

The goal of this thesis is to build a neural network aimed to estimate different parameters that describe the radiation pattern of an antenna, such as ellipticity, full width half maximum and cross-polarization as a function of the position on the focal plane of the instrument. In this thesis I also compared the performance of neural networks with traditional methods based on the interpolation of these parameters.
